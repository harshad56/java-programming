// COMPOSTION:
// The benefits of using Composition is as follows:
// 1)Composition allows the reuse of code.

// 2)Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritances but by using composition we can
// achieve it.

// 3)Composition offers better test-ability of a class.

// 4)By using composition, we are flexible enough to replace the implementation
// of a composed class with a better and improved version.

// 5)By using composition, we can also change the member objects at run time, to
// dynamically change the behaviour of your program.
